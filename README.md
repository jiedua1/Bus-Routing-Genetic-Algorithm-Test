# Bus-Routing-Genetic-Algorithm-Test
A prototype application that simulates school bus routing which implements an exact algorithm and a genetic algorithm used with a cost function that takes into account distance, driver's time, and student's time.

Source code and Jupyter notebook file is in the .ipynb file.
